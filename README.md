## About
This is a derivative of [QUAD](http://bitchin100.com/wiki/index.php?title=QUAD) by Steve Adolph.

## Differences from the original
Removed the resistor-cap power-on-reset for the flipflop, logic powered at all times along with the ram.

Aside from that, this PCB is drawn new from scratch, and the components are different versions & packages.

## Building
PCB from [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/MzAUrvu4) or [PCBWAY](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/reQUAD_RAM_Expansion_for_TRS_80_Model_100_8690cd19.html)  
[BOM](https://www.digikey.com/short/mt3jtw7q)

Note for PCBWAY: change "Min Track/Spacing:" to "6/6mil"  
When you order from PCBWAY the site preloads several settings and options automatically based on examining the gerbers.  
For this pcb for some reason it selects "Min Track/Spacing: 4/4mil", which makes the initial price over $50 before shipping.  
There are actually no traces or spaces under 6 mils on the board, so just manually change "Min Track/Spacing:" to "6/6mil" and the price drops to $5

## Usage
Use the software & directions for the original [QUAD](http://bitchin100.com/wiki/index.php?title=QUAD)

## Thanks
Steve Adolph for sharing his original design and allowing this derivative.
