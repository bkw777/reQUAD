## About
This is a derivative of [QUAD](http://bitchin100.com/wiki/index.php?title=QUAD) by Steve Adolph.

## Differences from the original
Removed the resistor-cap power-on-reset for the flipflip, logic powered at all times along with the ram.

Aside from that, this PCB is drawn new from scratch, and the components are different versions & packages.

<!--
## Building
PCB from [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/EzqwlTVX) or [PCBWAY](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/reQUAD_RAM_Expansion_for_TRS_80_Model_100_8690cd19.html)  
[BOM](https://www.digikey.com/short/m5tj4941)

The component legs are all tiny, but all parts can be soldered manually using the drag technique.

To solder the main PCB DIP legs, put some tacky flux on all the holes and insert all the pins,  
then put the the whole thing into a breadboard or a socket,  
then solder two opposite corner pins from the top, then all the rest.

## Usage
Use the software & directions for the original [QUAD](http://bitchin100.com/wiki/index.php?title=QUAD)

## Thanks
Steve Adolph for sharing his original design and allowing this derivative.
